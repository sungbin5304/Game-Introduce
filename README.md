### Overwatch
"Play the ultimate team-based shooting game on the battlefield of the future."

Blizzard Entertainment's team-based multi-play hyper FPS game.

### Void Memory
The story is simpler, easier to understand, connected length linearly, and since breaking a particular boss, it is kinder than one might think in its progression, with a particular NPC offering a direction for the next.

There is no currency concept in the game itself, and the level is not raised as a special item such as soul of the Soul series or salt of Salt and Saint-Chury, but rather as a pure hunt. As if you don't need any items or experience, if you keep catching monsters, there are no stores, and all you need is recovery or magic from the field or getting compensation from the NPC. There is an item called dress that changes the appearance itself instead of the equipment item, and although it does not seem to have any performance in terms of specifications, it is fun to decorate because it can change the appearance of a young body into various shapes.
